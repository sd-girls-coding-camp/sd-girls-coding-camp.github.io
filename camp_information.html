<div class="info_text">
	<p>This is a FREE camp for any female students in the San Diego area ages 12-17. The camp is sponsored by the Women in Computer Science Club at Westview High School and is taught by current Computer Science major college students. 	</p>

	<h2 class ="info_page_title">Goal</h2> 
</div>
<div class="info_text">
	<p>It is our goal to introduce girls to the world of computer science and teach them the basics of programming through the use of guest speakers from a variety of fields, and fun, interactive programming projects. After learning the basics, we hope they have the tools they need to continue their programming education through self-teaching or other programs.</p>

			<td>9:00am-12:00pm</td>
			<td>Beginner</td>
			<td class="left">This class is for students without any prior experience with computer programming. Students will be introduced to the basics, beginning with a discussion on how to think about code, what it is and the extent to which it is used to power the world around us. Starting by working with a basic programming language called Scratch and then moving into the programming language Java, students will learn  to create logical statements in code using loops, and/if statements, etc. Their final project will be programming a small robot "finch" to do fun tricks.</td>
			<td>Scratch, Java 
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>12:30pm-3:30pm</td>
			<td>Intermediate</td>
			<td class="left">This class is designed for students who have some prior programming experience or took our beginner course last year. In this intermediate course, we will begin with a review of the basics (data types, loops, etc) and then move into more intermediate level topics including methods, classes, along with data storage methods such as; stacks, arrays, queues. *note: students who have taken AP Computer Science will be too advanced for this class.</td>
			<td>Java</td>
