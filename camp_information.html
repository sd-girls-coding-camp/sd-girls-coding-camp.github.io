	<h2>Basic Camp Information</h2>
</div>
<div class="info_text">
	<p>This is a FREE camp for any female students in the San Diego area ages 12-17. The camp is sponsored by the Women in Computer Science club at Westview High School and is taught by current Computer Science major college students. 	</p>
</div>
<div class="info_header">
	<h2>Goal</h2> 
</div>
<div class="info_text">
	<p>It is our goal to introduce girls to the world of computer science and teach them the basics of programming through the use of guest speakers from a variety of fields and fun, interative programming projects. After learning the basics, we hope they have the tools they need to continue their programming education through self-teaching or other programs.</p>

		<tr>
			<td>9:00am-12:00pm</td>
			<td>Beginner</td>
			<td class="left">This class is for students who have never seen programming before. The class will start by working with a simple programming language called Scratch and talking about how to think about code. By the end of the beginner course, students will learn to create logical statements in code using loops, and/if statements, etc. Their final project will be programming a small robot "finch" to do fun tricks</td>
			<td>Scratch, Java 
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>12:30pm-3:30pm</td>
			<td>Intermediate</td>
			<td class="left">This is a class for students who have either taken the beginner course at this camp last year, or have some experience programming. In the intermediate course, students start with a review of topics from data types to loops. By the end of the intermediate course,
 students will have learned about different ways of storing data such as in stacks, arrays, queues. Students who have taken AP Computer Science will be too advanced for this class.</td>
			<td>Java</td>
