<img src="kasey.jpg" alt="Kasey" style="display: inline; margin 0px;"><h2>Kasey Sanseverino</h2>
<h4>President/Founder</h4>
</br><p>Kasey is currently a rising senior at UCLA studying Math-Econ and specializing in Computer Science. She is a Westview High School alumni and grew up in Rancho Penasquitos. By creating this camp, Kasey hopes to give girls an opportunity to learn about programming and the ability to find out early if programming  is something they find interesting and want to persue in the future, an opportunity she never had. Her programming experience includes  Math and Computer Science classes she completed at UCLA, as well as her expereience as Facebook intern during the summer of 2015 and 2016. It is Kasey's goal to work on the business side of an established technology company and to eventually start her own business. </p>
