	<h2>Goal</h2> 
</div>
<div class="info_text">
	<p>It is our goal to introduce girls to the world of computer science and teach them the basics of programming through the use of guest speakers from a variety of fields and fun, interative programming projects. After learning the basics, we hope they have the tools they need to continue their programming education through self-teaching or other programs.</p>
